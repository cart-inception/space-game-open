## Procedural Asset Generation Strategy

### Benefits of Procedural Generation
- **Consistent Visual Style**: All assets will share a unified aesthetic
- **Reduced File Size**: Assets are generated at runtime rather than stored
- **Infinite Variety**: Generate endless variations of similar assets
- **Easy Iteration**: Quickly tweak parameters to adjust appearance
- **Scalability**: Generate assets at different quality levels for different hardware

### Implementation Approach
1. **Generator Classes**: Create dedicated classes for each asset type
2. **Parameter System**: Use JSON files to define asset parameters
3. **Noise Algorithms**: Implement Perlin/Simplex noise for natural-looking variations
4. **Texture Generation**: Create textures programmatically using Canvas API
5. **Caching System**: Store generated assets to improve performance

### Tools and Libraries
- **Noise Libraries**: simplex-noise, perlin-noise for terrain generation
- **Three.js Extensions**: three-procedural-planet for planet generation
- **Texture Helpers**: canvas-texture for procedural textures

This linear path provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing your space simulation game. Each step builds upon the previous one, allowing you to create a solid foundation before adding more complex features. Remember to test each component thoroughly before moving to the next phase, and don't hesitate to iterate on designs as you discover what works best for your game.
